Mailing list subscription confirmation notice for mailing list
malining-dev-public

mailinglist-dev-public@lists.devstuff.org mailing list.  To confirm that you
want to be added to this mailing list, simply reply to this message,
keeping the Subject: header intact.  Or visit this web page:

    https://lists.devstuff.org/confirm/mailinglist-dev-public/aou1348313a-ouae83Ã¶a-123


Or include the following line -- and only the following line -- in a

    confirm b07bec5da9a9c36cfe34e4984c6713261d1bf9c4

Note that simply sending a `reply' to this message should work from
most mail readers, since that usually leaves the Subject: line in the
right form (additional "Re:" text in the Subject: is okay).

disregard this message.  If you think you are being maliciously
subscribed to the list, or have any other questions, send them to
mailinglist-dev-public-owner@lists.devstuff.org.
